                <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that consists of layers of wide flat pasta sheets, typically alternated with rich and flavorful sauces.

                            Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.

                        <p>
                            Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.

                        <p>
                            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.

                        <p>
                            In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

                        <p>
                            To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.

                        <p>
                            Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4> 8. </h4>
                        <p>
                            Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.
