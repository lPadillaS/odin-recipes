                Birria is a mexican meat, adobo and dried chilli stew made by boiling the meat in the consome until it softens up, you can use goat, beef, lamb, mutton, pork, or whatever you'd prefer! Another great way of eating it is by shredding the meat and making quesabirrias.

            <p>
                For this recipe, we will be using a single pot!(a pressure cooker).

                    <h4> 1. </h4>
                    <p>
                        Start by saut√©ing your tomatos, onion and garlic in a pot until the vegetables are soft and aromatic.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4> 2. </h4>
                    <p>
                        Blend your sauteed vegetables (this is your adobo) and throw them back into your pot, then add 3 - 4 liters of water and add some salt (not too much, you can add more later on if necessary), along with your spices, (i recommend some allspice, bay leaves, a cinnamon stick, oregano and cumin). 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4> 3. </h4>
                    <p>
                        Throw the meat into the consome and close your pot, let it cook on medium-low until the meat is very soft.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4> 4. </h4>
                    <p>
                        Once everyhting is cooked, take the meat out of the broth and shred it, you also want to strain the consome to get all the spices out. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4> 5. </h4>
                    <p>
                        Serve and enjoy with lime and some chopped onions and cillantro.
